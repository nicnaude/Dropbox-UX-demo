## Notes
**Challenges encountered during the creation of this prototype:** 

1. Text wrapping does not automatically occur on Dropbox’s live terms of service page. I enabled shrinking on the web view to fit more content onto the viewcontroller and to eliminate right to left scrolling for the user.
2. I would like to refactor the new user viewcontrollers into a single viewcontroller to avoid unnecessary duplication of code.
